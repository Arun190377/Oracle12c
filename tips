Installation of Oracle 12c on Windows 10-
Tip#1

I followed this link - http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/db/12c/r1/Windows_DB_Install_OBE/Installing_Oracle_Db12c_Windows.html
This works fine as long as you are not planning for ODI installation.
If you are planning for ODI installation then character set has to be changed. Refer Doc attached (Changes in Oracle Installation).
If the above is not taken care of then repository creation of ODI will fail.
There are various ways of changing the character set after installation, but none of these worked for me. So i have to uninstall and reinstall Oracle 12c with new characterset.


Tip#2

Follow this link for ODI installation - http://www.redstk.com/installing-odi-12c-in-standalone-mode/
For standalone installation Oracle Fusion Middleware Component need not be installed. AgentDI is enough for working with ODIc

Tip#3

All command line in windows should be opened in 'Administrator' mode.
